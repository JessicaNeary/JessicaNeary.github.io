					How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion, purpose' lens?
				</h5>
				<p>
					Great in theory, but challenging to attain in real life. I imagine the reason most people chase pleasure as their first source of happiness is because it is the easiest to find. We often know what it is that will bring us pleasure, but knowing what we are passionate about, and knowing what our higher purpose is, are much tougher to discover. Whatsmore, even if we are intuned enough to know these things, finding a way to apply them to our work is another matter all together. Whilst these are good long term goals, they are not necessarily applicable or reachable in the short term, and thus not very useful for improving current motivation levels.
				</p>

				<h5 class="q">
					What are your core values?
				</h5>
				<p>
					Honesty, independance, and empathy. I am a very straightforward person, and as such prefer it when people are upfront and honest with me, so everyone knows what page they are on. I also value my own independance greatly, and believe everyone should have the freedom to make their own choices. I feel most problems, both personal and across the world, can be attributed to a lack of percieved freedom. Finally, I believe that we are all intrinsically connected, and that we are all intuned with the negative and positive emotions of those around us. Therefore, improving others happiness can have a direct effect on our own happiness, and empathy is the most important value for the world as a whole.
				</p>

				<h5 class="q">
					What do you stand for?
				</h5>
				<p>
					For everyone and everything in the world to feel safe and valued. The 'me and mine' mentality is responsible for all strifes and struggles in the world, and if we all cared a bit more about others and about the world, these struggles wouldn't have to exist. The best way to improve our own lives is to improve everyone's lives, and if we cared more about the collective good than our own selfish desires, we would all be better off.
				</p>

				<h5 class="q">
					How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?
				</h5>
				<p>
			  	I discovered that I do not experience or even really acknowledge my own successes. When it came to remembering a time I was successful and re-experiencing how that felt, I realised that I view success as the default and as such do not feel anything when I succeed. I immediately move onto worrying the next task, without pausing to congratulate myself for what I have done. This is a very unhealthy habit, and I need to remember to actively experience my successes before I jump to thinking about the next task.
