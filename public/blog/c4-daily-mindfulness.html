					What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
				</h5>
				<p>
			  	It is a good way of approaching conversation, but we both found it a bit much to formally enforce it. Giving someone your full attention when they are speaking seems less a matter of 'mindfulness' and more a matter of politeness.
				</p>

				<h5 class="q">
					Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
				</h5>
				<p>
					Number 2, where you do less than you can and meditate for less time than it takes for me to get bored. For me this means I will meditate for &lt5 mins at a time, at least once a day.
				</P>

				<h5 class="q">
					Any other musings?
				</h5>
				<p>
					I found the concept of walking as a form of meditation interesting. Particularly when paired with the 'Joyful Meditation'idea. I will be sure to practise this as often as possible, particularly with the weather getting warmer and the beach a short walk down the road.
