					A time I got blocked on a simple problem
				</h5>
				<p>
					During the minesweeper assignment I got blocked a fair few times, one major problem being that everytime I clicked on one cell, all the cells would reveal themselves. Turns out this wasn't a bug, but part of the functionality of minesweeper, but it took me a few hours of problem solving to realise this. First I used dev tools to try and figure out what was going on, creating breakpoints where I thought the issue might be and stepping through the program. This didn't help, so I then put the code into a validator, jslint.

					Unfortunately this didn't supply the source of the problem either, at which point I posted on slack and went back to revising my Javascript basics to see if I was understanding how properties, objects and arrays worked. This whole process was very frustrating, as when you can't figure out where a program is going wrong it makes it very hard to solve the problem. My problem was then resolved, or rather, revealled to not be a problem. This has taught me to remember what it is I am trying to achieve with a program. For future assignments, this will mean taking more detailed notes on what each function of the program is, before I jump straight into writing my pseudocode.

					A time I solved a problem in an elegant way
				</h5>
				<p>
					During my debugging for the previous problem, I wound up changing something that stopped my program from displaying at all. This was again a very frustrating experience, as I couldn't remember what I had done that had broken the program. After reading through my code several times, changing a few things to no avail, I used the same problem solving method as before, putting my code into jslint at which point it was revealled I had a stray } further down in my code stopping the program from executing properly. From this I have learnt to check my syntax and validate my program before I waste time rewriting code to check other, more complicated potential issues.

				<h5 class="q">
					How confident am I using the problem solving process?
				</h5>
				<p>
					Overall I feel pretty confident with the problem solving process. I really enjoy solving problems, which is what drew me to coding in the first place, though I need to work on my frustration levels when a solution is taking a while to find. Pseudocode is extremely helpful for setting up a program and looking at the greater functionality of the program, but not so great for the small, tricky to find problems I often run into. Trying something is my go to method, but I need to keep better track of what I am trying and ensure I can easily revert if what I try doesn't work.

					I find it challenging to articulate my problems, so find the rubber ducky method a struggle. I am relatively confident console logging and reading error messages, and find it invaliable for spotting the source of my problem, even if solving the error is still quite tough. Google is great for the documentation side of things, but when it comes to solving specific problems I find it very confusing trying figure out if other problems on SlackExchange etc. are related to my issue. I have no problem asking for help, but it tends to be the last avenue I try, when I really should be utilising it more and asking earlier.

				<h5 class="q">
					.map()
				</h5>
				<p>
					This function takes a group of objects called an array and creates a new array from it with the elements (objects) in a specified order
				</p>

				<h5 class="q">
					.filter()
				</h5>
				<p>
					This function takes a group of objects called an array and creates a new group without the objects caught by the filter.
				</p>

				<h5 class="q">
					.reduce()
				</h5>
				<p>
					This function takes a group of values and applies a function to it to convert all the values into a single value. It does this in whatever manner you define, such as adding or multiplying the values together, or placing the values in a single array.
