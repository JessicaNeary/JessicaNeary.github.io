		<h4>
			What learnings did you take from the chapter?
    </h4>

		<p>
			I learnt that mindfulness and meditation can improve your attention and memory. I have always had a very poor memory, so learning that I can improve this is nice. Most of the concepts in the first chapter were already familiar to me, as having GAD I have spent some time prior to the course exploring my mind and the ways in which behavior can be changed. However was good reading the example studies in the chapter and seeing that these ideas can be backed up by science and aren't just 'hippie psychobabble'.

		<h4>
      How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?
    </h4>

		<p>
			That two minutes wasn't enough. I have attempted meditation in the past, and find it takes me at least 5 minutes to get myself to stop thinking about all the things I have to do and become really present in the moment. I know the more I practise this the faster I'll be able to get into the right mindset, at which point two minutes might be all I need, but as a beginner I did not feel much better after just two minutes.
