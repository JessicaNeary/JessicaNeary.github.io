					Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?
				</h5>
				<p>
					Trusting people is my default, and as such I do not have anyone in my life currently who I do not trust, aside from those who have given me reason to do so. However, I will do my best to remember these techniques for next time I meet someone new, and try talk about personal things to establish their trust in me.

				<h5 class="q">
					How did you find the loving kindness meditation?
				</h5>
				<p>
					I felt good afterwards. After only one session I can't say I feel considerably different about any of the people involved, but I agree that being kind or even just thinking kind thoughts about others makes you feel good, so it is certainly a worthwhile exercise for the future.
