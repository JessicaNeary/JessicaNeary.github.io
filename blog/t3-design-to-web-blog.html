			<h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h4>
			<p>
				A responsive site is one in which the elements change depending on the screen size. This might mean their size, their position, or whether they are visable.
			</p>

			<h4>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h4>
			<p>
				Mobile first design is designing how your site looks on a mobile first, then how it looks on larger screens like a desktop. This is because mobiles are the minimum size, so we use the minimum number of elements needed. When it comes to adjusting the design for other screen types, we aren't trying to cram a large number of things onto a smaller screen.
			</p>

			<h4>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h4>
			<p>
				A framework is a supporting structure of code, typically written by someone else, onto which web developers can program their site and applications. This saves having to rewrite structural code snippets, and provides a good starting platform for writing common web applications. A con of using frameworks is that it isn't always clear what the framework is doing, which can make it difficult to make your code operate as designed.
			</p>

			<h4>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h4>
			<p>
				A wireframe is a basic template of a website, showing the basic layout without design elements like font or colour. It is simply to show what elements are on the page and where.
			</p>

			<h4>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</h4>
