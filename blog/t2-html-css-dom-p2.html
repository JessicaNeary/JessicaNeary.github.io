    <h4>
			What is grid based design?
    </h4>

    <p>
			Grid based design is where you break the design of a webpage down into a grid to make it easier to style. Each box in the grid can then be turned into a html tag and styled individually in css.
    </p>


    <h4>
      Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?
    </h4>

    <p>
			Responsive webpages change the elements on the page depending on the browser window. This means the design can adapt to still look good and easy to read on smaller screens, such as for mobile.
    </p>


		<h4>
			What is semantic structure?
		</h4>

		<p>
			Semantic structure is where elements are named in a way that makes it clear what it is to both the browser and the developer. For example the 'table' tag is clearly selecting a table element, while the 'div' tag is not clearly referring to anything. By giving div a class or ID it can become semantic, eg div class='header'
		</p>

		<h4>
			Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.
		</h4>

		<p>
			The normalize.css stylesheet seems useful, though without examining this in more detail it is hard to tell exactly how useful. By linking the stylesheet my css is supposedly displayed properly across all browsers. I am unsure whether this means I can omit brower supporting code (eg, adding a filter: alpha(opacity) property to support an opaque element in IE8 and earlier), or whether I should still include these as a backup.
