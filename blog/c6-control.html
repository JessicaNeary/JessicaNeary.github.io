					When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?
				</h5>
				<p>
					I, as I imagine many programmers are, get triggered when I cannot get a function to work after several problem solving attempts, or when I cannot understand something after an extended period of time. These give me an emotional response of extreme frustration. often followed by a drop in motivation. I imagine this stems from a lack of faith in my own intelligence and abilities, that often discourages me from doing anything for fear of a mediocre result.

				<h5 class="q">
					How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?
				</h5>
				<p>
					It seems as though it will be useful, and I will definitely be trying it next time a disproportionate negative emotion arises (which knowing me won't be far off). The reflection seems like the most useful part in the process for me, as while I am quite apt at recognising my own emotions and breathing through them, I have trouble fully letting them go. I imagine this stems from my habit of surpressing negative emotions, lest they overwhelm me, and distracting myself from the emotion rather than trying to understand and process it. With luck, this technique will help me break this habit and ease my emotional responses, rather than my current unhealthy strategy of burying them until the pile is too big to ignore.
