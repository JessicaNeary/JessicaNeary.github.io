		<h1>Meditation Process</h1>

			<h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
			<p>I used it to rein in my perfectionist tendancies during the design period, reminding myself that how the site functions was more important than how it looked at this stage. I also kept the elements simple and familiar so that, rather than getting distracted by features like dropdown menus, I would have time to focus on getting the responsiveness of the site working well, and understanding how I did that. 
			</p>

			<h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
			<p>I view it positively and have tried it myself in the past. I have trouble remembering to do it often enough to notice much difference, but I believe in it's benefits.
			</p>

			<h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
			<p>
				I learnt that it can improve your immunity, which is surprising, but I suppose fits with the old adage of 'health mind, healthy body'
			</p>

			<h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
			<p>
				The acting with intention stood out to me. I have heard previously that you are supposed to acknowledge distractions, then let them go while meditating. Now I will try applying an intention to my meditative sessions, and allow myself to itch while being aware of the intention behind it.
			</p>

			<h4>Any other musings?</h4>
      <p>
				While it is interesting to learn how meditation works, I think my barrier is more the 'habit' side of this particular habit. I need to get into the habit of meditating more, and remember to try it every day if possible.
