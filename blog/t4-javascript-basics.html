				<h5 class="q">
					How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
				</h5>
				<p>
					  Javascript allows for much more dynamic websites, as rather than simply coding a static site, we can create elements that adapt themselves based on a number of factors, such as user input or time elapsed.
				</p>

				<h5 class="q">
					Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
				</h5>
				<p>
					Consider the example of cleaning the windows. Control flow is the order in which you execute the cleaning steps, in a logical fashion from the first step to the last. Your 'cleaning loop' has two steps - spraying the windows, and wiping them down. This loop repeats until the condition is met, in this case, until the window is clean.
				</P>

				<h5 class="q">
					Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.
				</h5>
				<p>
					When accessing data from an object you use the property name to reach the data, i.e: objectname[propertyname] or objectname.propertyname. When accessing from an array you use the index of where in the array the data is located, i.e: for an object in the first space in an array objectname[0]
				</p>

				<h5 class = "q">
					Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
				</h5>
				<p>
					A function is a block of code that performs a specific task when executed. Functions save you repeating code when you want the same thing to happen more than once and let us do the same thing to multiple objects with multiple parameters.
