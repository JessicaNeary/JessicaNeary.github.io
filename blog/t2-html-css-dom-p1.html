    <h4>
      Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
    </h4>

    <p>
      Imagine writing a program as creating a garden. The HTML is the contents of the garden; what plants you are using, how many retaining walls you are using and what goes in each section of the garden. CSS is the design elements of the garden; the size of the lawn, the placement of the plants, the colour of the fence. The DOM is the property itself, holding all the elements of the garden.
    </p>


    <h4>
      What is meant by boxifying design?
    </h4>

    <p>
      Boxifying design is when you split all the design elements on a page into boxes, so you can easily turn each box into an html container and arrange them as need be.
    </p>


    <h4>
      What is the box model?
    </h4>

    <p>
     Each HTML element sits in a CSS box. This is the 'content' box. The content box sits inside a 'padding' box, which sits inside a 'border' box, which is inside of a 'margin' box. The properties of each of these boxes can be adjusted in CSS.
