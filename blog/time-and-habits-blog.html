    <h2>Time and Habits</h2>
    <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
      <p>I summarised the main points I resonated with from each link into a set of notes, so have essentially been working with an almagamation of them. I have been trying to meditate more and timebox everything, as well as ignoring my lizard brain and give myself the conditions necessary to achieve flow. I have tried the pomorado technique in the past, but did not find it was for me, as frequent breaks disturb my workflow. </p>
    <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
      <p>Learning how mediation actually affects the brain was very interesting. I also enjoyed reading the Growth Mindset notes on how confidence is just displayed ability.</p>
    <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
      <p>I found the Counter-intuitive Productivity techniques very helpful. Reminding myself that I was doing something interesting and workwhile stopped me from falling into the procrastinators mindset. I didn't scold myself for taking too long breaks, knowing it would improve my mindset and improve my focus when I did return to work. The waffle cards helped me break the workload into nice, non-intimidating chunks, and I found by changing what I was working on every couple hours I avoided getting bored and losing flow.</p>
    <h4>Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
      <p>I will reread my productivity notes every so often and work to apply the behavior techniques to all aspects of my life. I need to remember to keep things small and not get overwhelmed by a bigger picture, doing things because they are interesting rather than with the aim of getting really good at them. I will also make an effort to meditate often and use a laptop instead of desktop so I can only have so much running at a time and can physically take myself away from distractions.</p>
