					What is scope?
				</h5>
				<p>
					In programming, scope determines which variables you can access. A variable is a stored piece of data. This could be a single value, an object, or a block of code. When a variable has a Global scope, this means it can be accessed and used anywhere in the program. We give variables a global scope by declaring them outside of any functions, usually at the start of the program. Declaring a variable is simply creating and naming it for the first time.</p>

        <p>
          When a variable has local scope, it only exists inside the function it is declared in. A function is a group of code that performs a specific 'function'. This means we can reuse variable names, and be sure that a variable is only being affected by the code inside that function. When it comes to debugging, we then only have to worry about that group of code, rather than our whole program.</p>

        <p>
          Other programming languages have other types of scope, such as block scope, where the variable only exists inside the if block or loop it is declared in. For Javascript, we only need to worry about Global and Local scope.
