					What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?
				</h5>
				<p>
					Compassionate leaders are always a better experience than non-compassionate leaders. The classes we enjoy the most and therefore generally perform the best in are those where the teachers understand us and want to help us to succeed. Likewise, the best jobs, both mental health and performance wise, are always those where bosses geniunely care about their employees.

					Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?
				</h5>
				<p>
					At first I wasn't really into it. The visualisation was easy to picture but hard to really believe, so my mind kept wandering as the time dragged on. Then in the final minute or two I was struck with a profound sense of calm. The white glow I was uninvested in became a soothing light that grew to fill the whole room. It was as if the world behind my eyelids had become brighter (though the shining sunlight outside might have had something to do with that). I even ended up continuing the visualisation for a few extra minutes.

				<h5 class="q">
					Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?
				</h5>
				<p>
					This was not quite as pleasent as the Multiplying Goodness meditation. I found 'breathing in' other's pain and suffering was nicer than breathing in my own. My experience might be different when I am in a different mood, but as I was already feeling good from the previous meditation, breathing in my fears and anxieties again just felt like reminding myself of them after I'd already let them go.

				<h5 class="q">
					How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?
				</h5>
				<p>
					As there has been very limited social interaction with the rest of my cohort at this stage, it hasn't really come into play too much yet. Status and Relatedness will probably be the main players in bootcamp, with the status being dictated by who knows the most about whatever our latest task is. In this way, the status will likely be quite fluid, as we all have different strengths and weaknesses. Our level of autonomy will vary from project to project, and may create some tension when working in teams if someone does not feel they have enough control over the project. Certainity may have an impact latter in the bootcamp, as deadlines loom and we are uncertain if we will complete our projects on time. Fairness will hopefully not be an issue, but is definitely something to be concious of during our various interactions.
