    <h2>28th September 16 - Blog Entry 1</h2>
    <h1>Inital Reflection</h1>

    <p>My first impressions of the EDA experience are overwhelmingly positive. I have studied Computer Science at University previously, so at this stage my opinions are mostly as a comparison to the traditional tertiary route. Initally EDA feels much more supportive and personal, with far smaller class sizes and a tutor-student ratio that will no doubt be a strong influence on my learning experience. I have previously been a very individual learning, preferring plugging my ipod in and getting on with the work to group discussion. While this does have it's advantages I feel it has hindered my learning overall. My first year at Uni I had several friends doing the same courses as me who I could clarify instructions and seek help with. Second year this changed, and I frequently found myself stuck and unwilling to reach out to busy lecturers or student tutors busy with their own assignements. With EDA I have already been using Slack to communicate with my cohort and ensure I am on track, and whilst I have had no major road blocks so far, I know when I do help will not be far away.</p>

    <p>I was initally quite nervous that I would struggle with the workload in the later phases and get overwhelmed, but now knowing that I can retake a phase with no financial penalty, I am feeling much more confident. Worrying about failing and wasting my course fees was a huge cause of stress in my previous studies, so it is a relief to know I no longer need to clutter my head with financial fears and can focus entirely on my learning. My other concern is the typical woe of the socially inept - will I be able to interact with these new people without coming across as a weirdo, or worse, a snob? Will I be able to communicate my ideas clearly and understand those around me? While this does add a few nerves, I am overall excited to be put out of my comfort zone and challenged to work with people I don't know, as these are skills I know I lack and need to work on. The emphasis on the EDA culture assures me that this will be a welcoming environment and one that will get me ready for the social and collaborative aspects of the workforce.</p>

    <p>I am excited to continue my coding education and become a Full-Stack Web Developer, and can't wait to start making some cool programs.</p>
