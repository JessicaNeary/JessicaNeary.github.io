					What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
				</h5>
				<p>
					They are essentially the same. They are both primarily about self-reflection, being aware of your thoughts, sensations and emotions, and both have the end result of improving your emotional intelligence.
				</p>

				<h5 class="q">
					 Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
				</h5>
				<p>
					I did a body scan, and found it a pleasent experience. I have done these in the past, but from my toes to my head, so the SIY version was an interesting contrast. Remember a positive experience and experiencing it's effects on my body was very bizarre. Throughout the first phase of the exercise I was very tense and stressed, but once I started thinking about the positive experience I could feel the changes in my body as I become more relaxed and more aware.
				</p>

				<h5 class="q">
					 What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
				</h5>
				<p>
					That I need to remember this, and stop letting my emotions overwhelm me. The cloud imagery seems like it will be useful, as if I imagine my emotions as clouds they should (theoretically) be able to float away just as easily.
